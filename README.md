# Overview
Our goal is to provide the public with a product that will allow them to stay informed about the validity of information that is going around in the media. 
Users will need to sign up to be able to submit articles/videos for validity checks. An administrator will be given the power to also be able to submit items to be checked for validity as well as the grade an items validity.
